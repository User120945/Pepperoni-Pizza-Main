A Harris Poll taken in January of 2016 found pepperoni to be the most popular pizza topping in the United States. Although there are many pizza toppings to choose from, and it seems like pizza makers get more and more creative each year, pepperoni has held true as the favorite across decades. Below are a few fun facts about this American standard.

How Much Pepperoni Do We Consume?

Although we are aware of the love Americans have for pepperoni on their pizza, it may come as a bit of a surprise that we consume roughly 251,770,000 lbs. of pepperoni on our slices each year in the United States. That is quite an astounding amount, and when breaking down the numbers, that comes to an average of 689,780 pounds or 344 tons of pepperoni eaten every day!

One in Three Choose Pepperoni

A recent poll found that around 36% of Americans add pepperoni to their pie when placing an order. With it going well with so many ingredients, we aren’t too surprised by these numbers.

The First-Ever Online Purchase

A random fact to tell your friends and family when sharing a pie is that the first ever (or one of the first) online purchases was a pepperoni and mushroom pizza from Pizza Hut. All the way back in August of 1994, the pizza chain began selling pizzas on the internet. It is commonplace today, but they were clearly years ahead of their time.

Business Is Booming!

Whether it be pepperoni, sausage, cheese or any other topping, pizza is clearly one of America’s favorite food choices, as it is convenient and an overall crowd pleaser. Pizza is so popular, in fact, that it is a $37 billion industry! That’s a major boon for the economy; pizza companies help employ over a million people in the United States alone.
